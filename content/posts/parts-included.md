## just the basics

this project is built with the underlying ingredients:

- [Nuxt v3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/)
- [@nuxt/content v2](https://content.nuxtjs.org/)
- basic [scss](https://sass-lang.com/)

components

- basic `Nav` component
- a simple `Card` component
- the most basic `Footer` component

##### why Nuxt 3

Vue is awesome, that's why. If you've ever played in the VueJS ecosystem, then you'd understand what I meant. Obviously, Nuxt is built on top of Vue, and IMO, the framework offers a robust foundation without confusing its user _that_ much.

Call me a nerd, but I also enjoy writing in `markdown` and `frontmatter` for the same reasons, ease of use.
