## motivation

I wanted to write again. This time, with less focus on platform, metrics, and overhead. And instead of revamping an old project or spinning up and hacking on top of some static-gen site build, I decided to learn some of the latest that's been happening in the world of Nuxt, particularly w/ their [@nuxt/content](https://nuxtjs.org) module.

##### the result

For the most part, the project setup is very minimal, with the intent that consumers have the flexibility to overwrite project decisions with their own architectural or code-style choices.

Please check the [ramblings nuxt blog starter repo on GitHub](https://github.com/techtolentino/nuxt3-blog-starter) for instructions on how to get started.
