##### Can I use this to build my own blog?

Absolutely! Just keep in mind that [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/) is still in a work in progress, and is currently available as a release candidate. For smaller, personal projects, I'd recommend it. However, the team is continually making updates, which you can read about on their roadmap.


##### What is Nuxt anyway?

Nuxt is a web application framework that is built on top of VueJs. In my humble opinion, both technologies are `<air-quotes>` relatively simple `</air-quotes>` to learn, and have a lot to offer.


##### Why doesn't this project come with more components?

That's up to you to build. Check out docs on [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org) components for more direction on how to get started.


##### How do I get started?

Visit the GitHub repo for instructions. TLDR â€” clone the repo, install dependencies, run `npm run dev`, and visit `localhost:3000`.

##### Why isn't hot module reloading working for me?

No clue, I'm running into the same issue. :man-shrugging:
